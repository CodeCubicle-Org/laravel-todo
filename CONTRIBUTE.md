# Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of negative sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances to a person
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without * explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

# Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

# Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

# Submitting Your Code on GitHub
There are just a few things to remember so far when submitting your code here on Github.
* Always write a description in your commits and most of all a really verbose and comprehensive description for all your **PullRequests**! It will help to avoid a lot of asking back and lengthy discussions to find out what you were thinking. And it will get your PR accepted much quicker
* Always write **unit tests** for every feature, not necessarily for every single function though. We want to speed up install and test processes and make this piece of code more reliable in general.
* Add proper and very comprehensive **code documentation** so everyone after you (including you in a few months) can understand your code quickly without the need to ask back.
* **Format your code nicely** and for this the use of a professional IDE like phpstorm can help a lot!
